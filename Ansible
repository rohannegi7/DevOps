Ansible- Push type configuration management tool
Pull = Slaves/Nodes checks master/server periodically and fetch configurations from it (Chef and puppet)
Push = Server/Master pushes the configuration to the nodes/salves.

Agentless- Means ansible is installed only in your local machine, and there is no supporting software or plugin installed on your client/nodes.
That means there is no agent on the other end, and local machine has complete control, hence it is called Agentless.  

Architecture : Local machine/Master server and Remote servers/clients/slave nodes via SSH.

Installation :-
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version 		


Cluster Formation :-
1.Configuring SSH Keys:
Master:
  ssh-keygen
  sudo cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
Slave:
sudo nano /.ssh/authorizedkeys

2.Creating Hosts:
cd /etc/ansible					(to go to ansible directory)
sudo nano hosts					(to edit hosts file)
[Group name/Test/Webservers]
Private IP of slave1
URL of webserver
[Group2 name/Prod/dbservers]
Private IP of slave2


[ansible_client]
Private IP of client machine ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=simplilearn


3.Check connectivity = ansible -m ping all
